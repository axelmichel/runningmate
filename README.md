# RunningMate

RunningMate is a Python-based application designed to process, analyze, and visualize activity data. The current release supports cycling, running and walking activity data in form of `tcx` files. The application is built using the [PyQt6](https://pypi.org/project/PyQt6/) library for the GUI, Pandas for data processing, and [folium](https://python-visualization.github.io/folium/latest/) for visualization.

The app does not store any of your data outside of your local machine. All collected data can be found in the `runningData` folder within your home directory. The imported `tcx` files are zipped, and the extracted data is stored in a SQLite database. Uploaded media files are stored in the `media` folder. Generated images like track maps or elevation charts are located in the `images` folder. In the current Version this app does not support multiple users.

## Features
- Map of each track.
- Elevation graph.
- Abstract map image of the track to share or use as overlay for images.
- Calculation and visualization of key metrics such as distance, pace, speed, heart rate, power,and elevation gain.
