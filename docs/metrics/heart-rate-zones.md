# Heart rate zones
Heart rate zones are a way to categorize the intensity of your training based on your heart rate. They are often used to structure training plans and to monitor the intensity of your workouts.

## The zones
| **HR Zone** | **% of HR Max** | **Intensity Level** |
|------------|---------------|------------------|
| **Zone 1** | 50–60%        | Recovery         |
| **Zone 2** | 61–70%        | Endurance        |
| **Zone 3** | 71–80%        | Tempo            |
| **Zone 4** | 81–90%        | Threshold        |
| **Zone 5** | 91–100%       | Anaerobic / Sprint |

## Calculation
In the Karvonen method the thresholds are calculated as a percentage of the difference between resting HR and max HR (termed heart rate reserve HHR). 
$$
HRR = HR_{\text{max}} - HR_{\text{min}}
$$
And with the heart rate reserve (HRR) the zones can be calculated:
$$
THR_{\text{min}} = HRR * Intensity-{\text{min}} + HR_{\text{min}}
$$
$$
THR_{\text{max}} = HRR * Intensity_{\text{max}} + HR_{\text{min}}
$$

The *HRmax* may be calculated by a maximal exercise test or by using an age predicted formula. There are two formulae currently favoured:

- HRmax = 220 - (age)
- HRmax = 206.9 – (0.67 x age) (*Tanaka, Monahan, & Seals, 2001*)

Additionally, the weight has an effect on the calculated HRmax. Is the bmi higher than 30, the recommended HRmax formula is:

- HRmax = 200 - (.5 * age)
